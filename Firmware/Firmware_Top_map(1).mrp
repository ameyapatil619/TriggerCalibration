Peak Memory Usage:  295 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  5 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_clk_20M/XLXI_2/CLKDV_BUFG_INST" (output
   signal=clk_20M) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads
   are:
   Pin D of XLXI_18/XLXI_8
WARNING:LIT:175 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_XLXN_441/XLXI_37" (output signal=XLXN_441) has a mix
   of clock and non-clock loads. Some of the non-clock loads are (maximum of 5
   listed):
   Pin D of XLXI_38/XLXI_27/XLXI_32
   Pin CLR of XLXI_21/XLXI_25/wait_f
   Pin CLR of XLXI_21/XLXI_25/full_f
   Pin CLR of XLXI_21/XLXI_25/done_f
   Pin CLR of XLXI_21/XLXI_25/addr_0
WARNING:LIT:178 - Clock buffer BUFGMUX symbol "physical_group_XLXN_488/XLXI_95"
   (output signal=XLXN_488) does not drive clock loads. Driving only non-clock
   loads with a clock buffer will cause ALL of the dedicated clock routing
   resources for this buffer to be wasted. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I0 of XLXI_59
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net clk_test_stop is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_38/XLXN_121 is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:LIT:66 - BUFGMUX chain detected. Two or more BUFMGUXs are connected in
   series. Because non-standard routing resources must be used to connect the
   BUFGMUXs, this chain can result in: 1) skew between the clocks derived from
   outputs of different stages of this chain, and/or 2) skew between the
   resulting clock and clocks that use other BUFGMUX paths.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------

Section 5 - Removed Logic
